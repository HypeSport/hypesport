This enthusiastic group of Sillimanians showcased their athletic prowess and tenacity, leaving an indelible mark on the international stage.

Among the participants, the women's and mixed division squads emerged as shining stars, securing the first runner-up position in their respective categories. Their journey to the finals was marked by remarkable victories against formidable teams from Japan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. However, in the ultimate face-off, they faced a formidable opponent from Taiwan, ultimately earning the well-deserved runner-up position. Their achievements stood as a testament to the excellence of local players, even when competing on the international arena.

The men's division exhibited commendable performance throughout the tournament, ultimately clinching the second runner-up spot. Despite facing tough adversaries, including a formidable Australian team, the men's squad displayed unwavering resilience. In a thrilling match against the host country, Indonesia, they battled their way to a hard-fought bronze medal, showcasing their determination and skill. This podium finish underscored their dedication and marked a significant milestone for Silliman University in the ARF Cup 2023.


Reflecting on their achievements, Francis Aldecoa, a third-year entrepreneurship student and a key participant, emphasized the importance of support from the university and fellow students for local athletes. He expressed their determination to set even higher goals, aspiring to participate in global tournaments, representing not only themselves but also their alma mater and the Philippines on the international stage..

Maikela Solomon, an esteemed alumna from the College of Business Administration and a member of the women's squad, shared her insights on this significant victory. According to her, this triumph is a testament to the exceptional skills of local players, showcasing their capabilities at the global level. She passionately encouraged fellow Sillimanians to engage with the sport, suggesting its incorporation into university physical education classes. Moreover, she extended her expertise as a coach and trainer, welcoming interested individuals to join training sessions held at Rusi Ballfield and Ang Tay Golf Course.

The remarkable Sillimanians who represented the Philippines in the ARF Cup 2023 included Jesse Apor, Elizabeth Jane Sienes, Harritz Libatog, Lytton Artiaga, Kirk Masangkay, Kyle Reynado, Jason Papelleras, Aileen Anlap, and Janixter Jordan. Their participation not only showcased their individual talents but also highlighted Silliman University's potential as a nurturing ground for skilled athletes competing at the highest levels on the international stage.
